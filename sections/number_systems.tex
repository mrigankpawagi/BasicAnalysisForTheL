\subsubsection{Definition}
\begin{true}
A relation $R$ on $A$ is a \textbf{partial order} if it satisfies
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reflexivity, i.e., $xRy \ \forall x \in A$
    \item Anti-symmetry, i.e., $xRy \land yRx \implies x = y \ \forall x,y \in A$
    \item Transitivity, i.e., $xRy \land yRz \implies xRz \ \forall x,y,z \in A$
\end{itemize}
Additionally, if $R$ satisfies
\begin{itemize}
    \item $xRy$ or $yRx \ \forall x,y \in A$
\end{itemize}
then $R$ is an \textbf{order} (or total order) on $A$. A set with a partial order is called a partially ordered set or \textbf{poset}, and a set with a total order is called an ordered set or \textbf{totally ordered set}.

Definition DefReflexiveRelationOn. 
    Let S be a set.
    A reflexive relation on S is a relation R on S such that
    xRx for every (x << S).

Definition DefAntiSymmetricRelationOn. 
    Let S be a set.
    An antisymmetric relation on S is a relation R on S such that
    (xRy and yRx => x = y) for every (x << S, y << S).

Definition DefTransitiveRelationOn.
    Let S be a set.
    A transitive relation on S is a relation R on S such that
    (xRy and yRz => xRz) for every (x << S, y << S, z << S).

Definition DefPartialOrderOn.
    Let A be a set.
    A partial order on A is a relation R on A such that
    R is reflexive and R is antisymmetric and R is transitive.

Definition DefOrderOn.
    Let A be a set.
    An order on A is a relation R on A such that
    (R is a partial order on A) and ((xRy or yRx) for every (x << A, y << A)).

Let R is a total order on A denote (R is an order on A).

Definition DefPartiallyOrderedSet
    A partially ordered set is a pair (A,R) such that A is a set and R is a partial order on A.

Let (A,R) is a poset denote ((A,R) is a partially ordered set).

Definition DefTotallyOrderedSet.
    A totally ordered set is a pair (A,R) such that A is a set and R is a total order on A.

Let (A,R) is an ordered set denote ((A,R) is a totally ordered set).
